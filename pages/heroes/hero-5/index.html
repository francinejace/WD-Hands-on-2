        <h3>Itsuki Nakano</h3><br>
        <p>Itsuki Nakano is the fifth sister of the Nakano Quintuplets.
            She is attributed as the "first girl" of the series.
            Itsuki is serious and diligent, yet she's also a glutton and crybaby.
            Itsuki is a serious girl, usually getting up early compared to her sisters.
            She also has good manners, to the point where she cares a lot about manners.
            She has never been late or skipped a class, and always speaks polite language.
